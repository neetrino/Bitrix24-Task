## Done

### Phase 1

- [x] Project size set to **B** (feature-based) in `.cursor/rules/00-core.mdc`
- [x] `docs/TECH_CARD.md` — stack: Neon, Prisma, Auth.js, Next.js, Vercel
- [x] `docs/01-ARCHITECTURE.md` — system architecture
- [x] `docs/02-TECH_SPEC.md` — functional/technical specification
- [x] `docs/BRIEF.md` — product brief
- [x] `docs/DECISIONS.md` — ADRs
- [x] CLI sync script and `plans/example.plan.yaml` (pre-existing)

### Phase 2–4 (implementation)

- [x] pnpm + Next.js App Router + Tailwind + strict TypeScript
- [x] Prisma schema (Auth.js tables, Project, Phase, Message, PlanSnapshot), migrations
- [x] Auth.js email magic link (Resend when configured; dev log otherwise)
- [x] Protected `/app` layout (server-side `auth()`)
- [x] Projects CRUD (create + Bitrix field settings)
- [x] Phases: list, create, scope chat/plan/export/sync by `?phase=`
- [x] AI chat + validated plan JSON + snapshots (OpenAI server-side)
- [x] Plan editor (JSON) + Markdown/YAML export routes
- [x] Bitrix sync (dry-run + live) reusing `src/server/bitrix/*`; CLI `src/sync-plan.ts` refactored
- [x] Optional Upstash rate limit for chat/sync (`UPSTASH_*`)
- [x] Vitest unit test, Playwright smoke, GitHub Actions CI

## In progress

- [ ] Broader Playwright coverage (login, project flows) — needs test mail or provider mock
- [ ] Production deploy checklist (Vercel env, Neon, Resend domain)

---

## Blocked / waiting

- OAuth / Google (optional; see `docs/TECH_CARD.md` §5)
- Adaptive DB limits (pool, timeouts) — team alignment per `00-core.mdc`
